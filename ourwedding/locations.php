			<h2>St Patrick's Church, Corracrin</h2>
			<img class="right" src="images/corracrin.jpg" alt="corracrin" width="220" />
				<p>Nestled among the rolling drumlins of North Monaghan is St Patrick’s Church, Corracrin. This charming, local church is where Cathriona celebrated her Baptism, First Holy Communion and Confirmation. St. Patrick’s National School is situated on the same grounds and it is here where Cathriona and her three brothers spent many happy school days. We’ll be enjoying refreshments in the newly opened school hall following the wedding service!</p>
